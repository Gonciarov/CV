## More about me

#### I learn quickly

- In May 2020, I decided to start Makers Academy course one month earlier than I planned initially. For that, I had to quickly learn Ruby, as they test candidates tech skills in Ruby only and the deadline for passing the tests has been just in a week. Makers team suggested to take more time for preparation and join them one month later, but I wanted to start ASAP and learnt new language in a few days, to the level enough to pass the tests (those included classes and some maths methods).

- Before I even started my studies, I joint Codewars community and was able to solve 4kyu katas like [Snail](https://www.codewars.com/kata/521c2db8ddc89b9b7a0000c1) just in four days using new language.

- For our final project (September 2020), our Makers team decided to use ReactJS which I have never used before and therefore found myself blocked in first days of work. To get familiar with the framework, I created a simple React notepad app using tutorial just in one day, and eventually managed to make my fair contribution to the project.

- Also, learning new things from different fields has always been a part of my job as a journalist and editor. When I worked on article, I could have been required to familiarize myself quickly with something like current immigration law practice or property markets situation. Fast learning has been my daily routine for years.

#### Team worker

- I ask questions. Always prefer to ask someone more experienced rather than spend a day on resolving a technical issue by myself. It's not only about saving my time, it's about saving team's time.
- Have 10 years of experience of team work, from small teams of 5 employees to giants like BBC.
- Worked on different levels, from trainee to mid-senior roles.
- Experienced in representing company on conferences and industry events.
- Experienced in working with clients, can understand people's specific needs and expectations.
