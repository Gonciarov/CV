#### I learn quickly

When I just started my tech studies, I was doing Python lessons at the beginning and quickly switched to Ruby when decided to join Makers Academy. It took four days of intensive work to train myself to the level enough to pass the tests.

Also, it was my routine as a journalist to learn something new from very different fields. When I worked on article, I could have been required to familiarize myself quickly with something like current immigration law practice or property markets situation. Learning was my daily routine for years.
