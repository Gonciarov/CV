## Ilja Gonciarov

Enthusiastic and energetic brand new Full Stack Junior Developer backed by 10 years of experience in media as an editor and journalist. Good at problem-solving, fact-checking, as well as explaining complicated things in simple words and edit text (or code) to make it readable and understandable. 
Started coding as a hobby during 2020 pandemic, joined Makers Academy tech bootcamp and making it a new profession.   

## Skills

#### Great team member
It takes 2-4 weeks to fully join a team of 30-40 people and become a normal part of their working landscape. I also happened to build one team myself, so I know what is to be a team leader and how to manage human emotions.

#### Excellent communicator and organiser
My day to day work in media included lots of communication with speakers, editors, journalists, stakeholders, customers and others. I am familiar to busy and demanding environment, able to work under pressure and meet deadlines while keeping working atmosphere positive and human-friendly.
I always ask questions. The most effective way to communicate is not to "wait and see" or else but to ask directly. What I worked out through my previous experience is that clearly formulated question is a half of solution (it really works).

#### Good at maths
(to be added)

#### Make things clear
I have read and edited hundreds of articles, understanding their value and inner logic in my previous career. I know how to explain complicated things in simple words and edit text (or code) to make it readable and understandable and strip it of unnecessary things.  Now I can do that with code too.

#### Learn quickly

When I just started my tech studies, I was doing Python lessons at the beginning and quickly switched to Ruby when decided to join Makers Academy. It took four days of intensive work to train myself to the level enough to pass the tests.

Also, it was my routine as a journalist to learn something new from very different fields. When I worked on article, I could have been required to familiarize myrself quickly with current immigration law practice or property markets situation. To learn was my daily routine for years.

#### Care about others
I never forget that people will read my text/code afterwards. Even if it is just for peers (and not for thousands of readers), making things clear and correct before submitting was a part of my routine for years.
