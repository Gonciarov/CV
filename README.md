## More about me (if you have one more minute)

#### I learn quickly

- For our final project (September 2020), our bootcamp team decided to use ReactJS which I have never used before and therefore found myself blocked in first days of work. To get familiar with the framework, I created a simple React notepad app using tutorial just in one day, and eventually managed to make my fair contribution to the project.

- Also, learning new things from different fields has always been a part of my job as a journalist and editor. When I worked on article, I could have been required to familiarize myself quickly with something like current immigration law practice or property markets situation. Sometimes I had only half a day to prepare for the interview with expert in some unfamiliar area like B2B-software, so I have a good experiences in grasping things fast. Urgent learning has been my daily routine for years.

- Before I even started my tech studies, I joint Codewars community and was able to solve 4kyu katas like [Snail](https://www.codewars.com/kata/521c2db8ddc89b9b7a0000c1) just in four days using new language.

#### Team worker

- I ask questions. Always prefer to ask someone more experienced rather than spend a day on resolving a technical issue by myself. It's not only about saving my time, it's about saving team's time.
- Have 10 years of experience of team work, from small teams of 5 employees to giants like BBC.
- Worked on different career levels, from trainee to mid-senior roles.
- Experienced in representing the company during conferences and industry events.


#### I have been in client's shoes

- In my previous career, I communicated with devs as a client and know how non-technical people feel when dealing with IT in their business.
- I am also experienced in working with clients as advertising partner and have good negotiating skills.
